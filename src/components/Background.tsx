                    I am currently in the process of switching careers by learning to code to start in the tech field. I 
                    have been working with people with disabilities as a Recreation Therapist for the past 6 years and I 
                    enjoy using my brain for problem-solving skills so my hope is to one day help create technology that 
                    is accessible and beneficial to everyone, including those with disabilities. I started self-learning online about a year 
                    ago and teaching myself some basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript for my Front-End skills. I am formally 
                    attending a Full Stack Web-Development course with Suncoast Developers Guild in order to further my 
                    studies and get serious about learning to code! I have so far learned the basics and fundamentals of C#, 
                    SQL statements, Typescript/ Javascript, and React; although I look forward to learning so much more and honing in my skills.
